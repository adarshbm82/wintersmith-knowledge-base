# Some Possibly Confusing Things

- There is both a "DOBT dashboard" and the screendoor app's "dashboard" ![screenshot](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2uhl5oxl4r6kjnl/Screenshot%202014-07-17%2013.21.26.png).

- Log In and Sign In are used in different places (e.g. dobt.co/screendoor and dobt.co).

- Project search does not seem to work. E.g. https://screendoor.dobt.co/account/projects?q=hiring

- I managed to get an app stuck at the "Enabling" stage, even though it seems installed. https://www.dropbox.com/s/g0gac1oy9csv9dz/Screenshot%202014-07-23%2010.48.52.png

knowledge_base
==============

The DOBT knowledge base.

## Overall Goals

Our users are largely non-technical, so it will be a good source of info for them. Use cases include:

- Using it to run trainings/self-trainings
- Linking to it when we get silly support requests
- Linking to it from pages inside of our apps
- Using it as a sales tool: sometimes, instead of giving a demo, we can link folks to the appropriate sections in the knowledge base

Also:

- It might be a good source of SEO for us
- It makes us seem more established, which is always a good thing

## Technical details

None, currently. Let's just write our content as well-structured markdown, and we'll deal with putting it on the web when the time comes. (We'll probably design a lightweight Jekyll template and serve it as static HTML.)

## F.A.Q.

### My password isn't working. Help!

If your password isn't working, make sure that you're signing in with the correct email address and confirm that your Caps Lock key is off. If it still isn't working, click the "Forgot?" button to the right of the password field to reset your password.

### What should I do if I've tried to reset my password, but have not received the email?

First, make sure that you submitted the correct email address, and check your spam folder to make sure the reset email wasn't accidentally filtered.

If it's been a while and you still haven't received an email, contact us at [support@dobt.co](mailto:support@dobt.co).

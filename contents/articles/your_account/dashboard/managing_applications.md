To change an application's URL, press the "Edit" button next to its name on the ["Your organization" page](https://dashboard.dobt.co/organization/). Enter a new URL, and then press the "Save changes" button. Note that your URL must be unique: if a URL has already been taken by another organization, we'll ask you to choose another.

### Removing an application

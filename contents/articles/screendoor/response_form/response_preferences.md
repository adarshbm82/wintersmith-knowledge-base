To configure preferences for responses, click "Edit project" and select "Responses" from the project checklist.

## Adding a response due date

Set a deadline for responses by selecting a date from the date/time picker.

![set due date](../images/screenshot_due_date.png)

If you need to extend the due date, simply return to this page and select a new date (You can also [extend the due date for a specific response](../responses/viewing_unsubmitted_responses.html#extending-the-due-date-for-a-specific-response)). Clear the due date and allow all responses by clicking "Clear due date."

### Adding a grace period

You can also add a grace period. During the grace period, draft responses can still be submitted but new responses cannot be created.

## Requiring Screendoor registration

By default, Screendoor requires respondents to be registered as Screendoor users. However, it's easy to waive this requirement by unchecking the "Require registration" box.

## Hiding respondent names

To hide respondent names from reviewers, check the "Treat respondent names as 'blind fields'" box.

## Displaying a custom "after response" page

To display a custom page to respondents after they submit their response, select "Display a custom page" from the "After response" dropdown.

![custom after response](../images/screenshot_after_response.png)

You can then write and preview your custom page under "After Response Page" in the project checklist.

## What time zone will the response due date be set in?
The response due date will be set in your current local time zone. The date/time will automatically be presented to users based on their own local time zone. For example, if you set the due date to 4:00pm and you are in the Pacific Time Zone, users on the East Coast will see the due date as 7:00pm.

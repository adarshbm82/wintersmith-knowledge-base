The following usages are prohibited, and will result in immediate termination of your use of the messages feature:

- Sending messages to respondents that have been imported from a 3rd party list, unless those respondents have given explicit consent to receive emails
- Using third party email addresses, domain names, or mail servers without proper permission (e.g. using a "reply-to" address that you do not own)
- Sending emails to non-specific addresses (e.g., webmaster@domain.com or info@domain.com)
- Sending emails that result in an unacceptable number of spam complaints (even if the emails themselves are not actually spam)

If you know of or suspect any violations of these guidelines, please notify us at support@dobt.co.

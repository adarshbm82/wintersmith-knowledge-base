## Viewing unsubmitted responses

To view all unsubmitted responses for your project, navigate to the "Responses" page and click the "View unsubmitted responses" link underneath the statuses and labels section. Note that in order to preserve the privacy of your respondents, you will only be able to view the validation status, respondent name, and last four digits of the response ID for these unsubmitted responses (not their actual contents). However, you can see how many validation errors have occurred so far and how many fields have been completed.

The goal of this page is to help you deal with any problems, issues, or questions that your respondents may encounter while filling out your response form. If a respondent needs help submitting their form, the "View unsubmitted responses" page will enable you to see what point they're at in the form and what they may need help with.

## Extending the due date for a specific response

To extend the due date for a specific response from the "View unsubmitted responses" page, click the "Extend" link next to the appropriate response and select an extended due date from the date/time picker.

To waive payment for a specific response, click the "Waive" link next to the appropriate response.

## Exporting responses

To export responses, navigate to the "Responses" page for you project. If you'd like to only export specific responses, check the box next to those responses. Then click "More" on the toolbar and select "Export responses."

From the "Export responses" popup, select which responses you'd like to export. You can also choose to export ratings and blind fields (if you have the appropriate permissions). Then, select the format you'd like to export as and click "Download" to begin the export process.

Depending on the format you've selected, Screendoor may email you a link to download your exported responses. If it does, just click the link in the email to download your responses.

## Can I export my entire project?
If you'd like to export a *complete* set of data for your project (as JSON files), you can do so from the "Settings" page. Just click the "Export project as JSON" link and then click the "Generate export" button from the popup. Note that Screendoor will process your export request and then send you an email with the download link once it's done.

Shortcuts are a foolproof way to automate the existing workflow behind your form. By performing routine, mundane tasks for you, shortcuts can help your team focus on what mattersâ€”evaluating responses, following up with respondents, and making smarter decisions, backed by data.

### Creating a shortcut

Go to your project's Responses page and click the Configure Shortcuts link in the lower left-hand corner.

Press the Add Shortcut button to configure your first shortcut. Select your options from the dropdown menus to trigger an action when a response is submitted, revised, or rated, or when its status or labels are changed.

Press the Add Shortcut button to create additional shortcuts.

### Editing and deleting shortcuts

Edit and Delete buttons appear next to each shortcut. Press the Edit button to change the settings of a shortcut. When you're done configuring the shortcut, press the Save button to save your changes.

### Reversing a shortcut

Whenever you trigger a shortcut, a notification appears on the lower right-hand corner of the page. To reverse the shortcut action, click the Undo link.

All actions related to shortcuts, even those that are reversed, are recorded in the activity feed.

### Understanding a shortcut

When a shortcut has been activated, collaborators with the appropriate permissions can see the shortcut's settings by clicking the View Shortcuts link in the notification.

### Your plan's limits

Each Screendoor plan has a limited number of _projects_ and _users_.

| Item  | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Projects | The number of projects allotted to your plan. Unless you are on a free plan, [archived projects](/articles/screendoor/projects/archiving_a_project.html) do not count against this limit. |
| Users | The number of [collaborators](../collaboration/collaborators.html) allotted to your plan. If someone in your organization collaborates on multiple projects, they will only count as one user. Collaborators on [archived projects](/articles/screendoor/projects/archiving_a_project.html) are not counted against your plan limit. |

Once you have reached the maximum amount of projects or users, you won't be able to add more until you [upgrade your plan](/articles/screendoor/your_account/billing.html#adding-or-changing-a-plan), [remove collaborators](/articles/screendoor/collaboration/collaborators.html#removing-collaborators), or [archive some projects](/articles/screendoor/projects/archiving_a_project.html).

<div class='alert'>
    **Note:** In addition to user and project limits, [e-signatures](../your_form/signatures.html), [teams](../collaboration/teams.html) and [Socrata sync](../integrations/socrata.html) are only available on some plans. See our [pricing page](https://www.dobt.co/screendoor/pricing/) for more information.

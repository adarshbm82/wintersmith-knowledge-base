title: Managing your plan limits
order: 5
---

Depending on your plan, Screendoor will limit the following items:

| Item  | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Projects | The number of active projects allotted to your plan. [Archived projects](/articles/screendoor/projects/archiving_a_project.html) do not count against this limit. |
| Collaborators | The number of [collaborators](../collaboration/collaborators.html) allotted to your plan. If someone in your organization collaborates on multiple projects, they will only count as one collaborator. Collaborators for [archived projects](/articles/screendoor/projects/archiving_a_project.html) are not counted against your plan limit. |

Once you have reached the maximum amount of projects or collaborators, you won't be able to add more of them until you [upgrade your plan](/articles/screendoor/your_account/billing.html#adding-or-changing-a-plan), [remove collaborators](/articles/screendoor/collaboration/collaborators.html#removing-collaborators), or [archive some projects](/articles/screendoor/projects/archiving_a_project.html).

In addition, [e-signatures](../your_form/signatures.html), [teams](../collaboration/teams.html) and [Socrata sync](../integrations/socrata.html) are only available for advanced plans. See our [pricing page](https://www.dobt.co/screendoor/pricing/) for more information.

### Managing projects

If you're an administrator in your organization, you can view a list of all of your organization's active projects. Click your avatar in the navigation bar and select ["Account"](https://screendoor.dobt.co/account) from the dropdown.

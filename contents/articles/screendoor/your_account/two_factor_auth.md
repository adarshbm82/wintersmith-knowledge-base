Make your account more secure by requiring an extra step for authentication. If you have a smartphone, you'll need either the [Authy](https://www.authy.com/) or [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en) mobile app. If you don't have a smartphone, you can use the [Authy Chrome app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/authy/gaedmjdfmmahhbjefcbgaolhhanlaolb).

### Enabling two-factor authentication

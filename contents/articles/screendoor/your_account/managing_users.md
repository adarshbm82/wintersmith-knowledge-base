### Inviting new users

If you are an administrator in your organization, you can add users from the ["Account" page](https://screendoor.dobt.co/account). Scroll down to the Users section, and press the "Invite a user" button.

Fill out the form on the next page and press the "Invite this user" button.

The invited user will receive a link to sign up for a Screendoor account, after which they will be added to your organization.

### Managing user permissions

When you add a user, you can choose the appropriate permissions for that user from the "Invite a user" page.

To manage permissions for an existing user, click on their name in the Users section of the ["Account" page](https://screendoor.dobt.co/account). This will take you to a page where you can change their permissions. Be sure to press "Save changes" when you're done.

### Resetting a user's password

Point the user to the [Signing in](signup_and_login.html) article, or have them email us at [support@dobt.co](mailto:support@dobt.co?subject=Reset password request).

### Removing users

<div class='alert'>
    **Note:** When you take a user off your plan, you remove them from projects they're a collaborator on. If they were the owner of a project, ownership of that project will be transferred to the owner of your organization.
</div>

In the Users section of the ["Account" page](https://screendoor.dobt.co/account), click on the delete icon next to the name of the user you would like to remove.

Then, confirm you want to delete this user in the modal dialog that appears.

Alternatively, click on the user's name in the Users list, and, on the next page, click "Take [this user] off your plan," and, in the modal dialog that appears, confirm you want to delete the user.

## Configuring response notifications

When you're Subscribed to a project, you'll also get Subscribed to all new responses by default. If you're not Subscribed to a project, you'll only be Subscribed to a response when you're mentioned in or assigned to it.

To change your notification level for a response, simply select the appropriate notification level from the "Notifications" dropdown on the response page.

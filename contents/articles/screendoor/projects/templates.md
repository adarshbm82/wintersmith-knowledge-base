Project templates allow you to re-use configuration settings from existing projects when you create new projects.

## Creating templates

To save an existing project as a template, click "Edit project," click the arrow next to the name of your project, and select "Save this project as a template."

![save project as template](../images/save_project_as_template.png)

You will then be re-directed to the "Project templates" page.

## Managing templates

From the "Project templates" page, you can view and manage your project templates.

![project templates](../images/project_templates.png)

## Using templates

To use a template for a new project, simply select it from the list of templates when you create a project.

![create project from template](../images/create_project_from_template.png)

## Importing templates

To import a template, click "Import a template" and select the appropriate file.

## Exporting templates

To export a template, simply click the "Export" link next to a template.

> **Note**: You can share these exported YAML files with other Screendoor users.

## If I accidentally delete a default template, can I recover it?
Yes! All the default templates are stored on our [Project Templates page](https://github.com/dobtco/screendoor-project-templates). Download the YAML file for the deleted template and then import it.

## Embedding the response form

Screendoor allows you to embed the response form for your project in your own website, making it even easier for responders to fill out your form. To embed the response form, click "Settings" from your project page and select "Embed code" from the boxes on the left-hand side of the page. Then, configure your embed code (add a custom stylesheet, skip the response preview, or configure what to do after the response has been submitted) and copy the HTML code under "Embed code" onto your own website.

Note that to use the embed code, you must allow responses from unregistered users, which you can do by clicking "Edit project," selecting "Responses" from the "Project checklist," and unchecking the "Require responders to be registered on Screendoor" box. Also, you must make your project live before you can receive responses.

Here is an example of a simple embedded response form for a live project:

## Importing responses

To import responses into your project from a [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file, select the "Import responses" box on the left-hand side of the "Settings" page for your project. Make sure your CSV file is properly formatted, and that it contains column headers as the first row. Select your CSV file, optionally add a label that will be applied to all imported items, and click the "Import responses" button to import responses from your CSV file.
